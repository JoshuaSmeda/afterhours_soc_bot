# TheHive_SLA_Monitor
This applications runs as a Linux service, queries TheHive (SIRP) alerts based on a set severity status while cross checking set SLA limits and then SMS's or calls specified people if there is a breach. This is achieved with the following technologies:

```
Python3
Flask
Twilio
Slack
TheHive (SIRP)
```

## Overview:

This application connects to your slack workspace using the Slack API. The application periodically polls the TheHive (every 2 minutes) https://thehive-project.org/ using a pre-defined API key. It grabs all pending alerts with a severity status of 3 (high) and performs SLA checks on the alerts. The following SLA's are outlined below:

30 minutes - SMS person scheduled "on-call" <br>
45 minutes - Call person scheduled "on-call" and echo a generic, pre-defined, message via Twilio using a Twimlet<br>
60 minutes - Escalate to seniors members, through phone call via Twilio <br>

Once a alert fires, it won't be re-alert on unless it hits a new SLA tier (e.g. Moves from 30 minutes to 45 minutes).

Each alert will create a slack notice that allows you to promote to case or ignore the alert for 30 minutes from within Slack instead of manually acknowledging the alert via the TheHive web interface. When promoting a case, Slack will link you to the imported case, when ignoring, the alert won't re-alert at 45 / 60 minutes for 30 minutes.

A log record is generated each transactional event which allows you to track and audit events.


## Configuration parameters:

The `configuration.py` is utilized as a central location to modify functionality and parameters related to the program. Such as, changing the severity level you wish to search TheHive for, or adjusting the SLA timers you wish to poll at. 

The following explains the parameters accepted:

```

SLA_SETTINGS = {
     # Int: seconds to classify the age of a low severity SLA breach in the form of seconds
     # Note: Do not adjust the key name as it's used in conjunction with a switch case function within the program.

    'LOW_SEVERITY': 1800,
    'MEDIUM_SEVERITY': 2700,
    'HIGH_SEVERITY': 3600,
    'HIGH_RISK_WORDS': ['CRITICAL', 'URGENT', 'FAILURE']  # List: Add custom words here that you want to be critically alerted on. These words must be included (non-case sensitive) in the Hive title or in one of the artifacts. This will immediately escalate to HIGH_SEVERITY SLA.
}

SYSTEM_SETTINGS = {
    'SEVERITY_LEVEL': 3,  # Int: The TheHive severity level you wish to query for. # Low = 1, Medium = 2, High = 3
    'HIVE_SERVER_IP': '192.168.1.15',  # String: The server IP or functioning DNS name of the TheHive instance you would like to query.

}

FLASK_SETTINGS = {
    'ENABLE_WEBSERVER': True,  # Boolean: Toggle to enable Flask to enrich the Slack integration. Set to False to disable.
    'FLASK_WEBSERVER_IP': '192.168.1.200',  # String: The IP of the instance you running this program on (will act as a webserver so needs to be reachable).
    'FLASK_WEBSERVER_PORT': 3000  # Int: The webserver port you wish to expose Flask on.

    'SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL': ''  String: Your Slack application webhook URL you generated. Obtain frmo your Slack instance.
}
```


## Adjust what gets alerted on:

If you wish to adjust / add / remove what happens when a alert hits a specified SLA tier and the alert method that gets triggered (i.e, send via Twilio / send via Slack). You can adjust the definitions under the `classmethods` within `main.py`

Existing configuration for reference to compare with below:

```
class EscalationSelector:
    """
    Dynamically escalate Hive alerts based on configured severity
    """
    @classmethod
    def escalate(cls, severity, *args, **kwargs):
        """
        This classmethod executes the approriate classmethod based on the providers severity attribute.
        """
        getattr(cls, f'{severity}')(*args, **kwargs)

    @classmethod
    def low_severity(cls, alert_id, rule_name, alert_date, alert_age, *args, **kwargs):
        """
        This classmethod alerts via Slack and sends an SMS to the person currently "on-call".
        """
        logging.warning('LowSeverity: Alert ID: %s. Rule Name: %s. Alert Date: %s. Alert Age: %s' % (alert_id, rule_name, alert_date, alert_age))
        Alerter().add_to_30_dict(alert_id, rule_name)
        Slack().post_notice(alert_id, rule_name, alert_date, alert_age)
        Twilio().send_sms(*args)

    @classmethod
    def medium_severity(cls, alert_id, rule_name, alert_date, alert_age, *args, **kwargs):
        """
        This classmethod alerts via Slack and makes a call to the person currently "on-call".
        """
        logging.warning('MediumSeverity: Alert ID: %s. Rule Name: %s. Alert Date: %s. Alert Age: %s' % (alert_id, rule_name, alert_date, alert_age))
        Alerter().add_to_45_dict(alert_id, rule_name)
        Slack().post_notice(alert_id, rule_name, alert_date, alert_age)
        Twilio().make_call(alert_id)

    @classmethod
    def high_severity(cls, alert_id, rule_name, alert_date, alert_age, *args, **kwargs):
        """
        This classmethod alerts via Slack and makes an escalated call once this tier is reached.
        """
        logging.warning('HighSeverity: Alert ID: %s. Rule Name: %s. Alert Date: %s. Alert Age: %s' % (alert_id, rule_name, alert_date, alert_age))
        Alerter().add_to_60_dict(alert_id, rule_name)
        Slack().post_notice(alert_id, rule_name, alert_date, alert_age)

```

For example:

Removing `Slack` posting for `high_severity` alerts:

```
@classmethod
def high_severity(cls, alert_id, rule_name, alert_date, alert_age, *args, **kwargs):
  """
  This classmethod alerts via Slack and makes an escalated call once this tier is reached.
  """
  logging.warning('HighSeverity: Alert ID: %s. Rule Name: %s. Alert Date: %s. Alert Age: %s' % (alert_id, rule_name, alert_date, alert_age))
  Alerter().add_to_60_dict(alert_id, rule_name)
  # Removed the Slack function reference!
```

## How to install:

To do:

Create a slack application to receive messages to your workspace - follow this guide: https://github.com/slackapi/python-slack-sdk/blob/main/tutorial/01-creating-the-slack-app.md <br>
Create a "echo" twimlet to playback a custom voice message when called by Twilio: https://www.twilio.com/labs/twimlets/echo <br>
Create a twilio account to receive calls / sms's

1. Install Python Virtual Environment ```python3 -m venv env```
2. Activate Virtual Environment ``` . env/bin/activate```
3. Install dependencies ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
4. Add in custom variables in ```configuration.py``` which is injected into the main application at runtime.
5. Run using ```python main.py``` - if you wish to run as a service, see below:

It's recommended to setup a reverse proxy to forward requests to your Python Flask server running (defined within ```configuration.py```). Here's a mini example using Nginx. Note, this is not configured for production use. Replace ```x.x.x.x``` with the IP address you plan on having your application listen on.

```
server {
  listen 80;

  location /web_api/ {
    proxy_pass http://x.x.x.x:3000/;
  }
}

```

Alternatively you can use ```ngrok.com``` to tunnel if you do not wish to use a webserver. This is discouraged due to the potential security risks associated with this.

## Create sysinitv service on Linux (Debian):

Place in ```/etc/systemd/system/thehive_sla_monitor.service```

```
[Unit]
Description=TheHive SLA Monitor

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/path/to/dir/env/bin/python /path/to/dir/main.py
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/dir/

[Install]
WantedBy=sysinit.target
```

Reload the daemon:

```systemctl daemon-reload```

Run / Start the bot with ```service thehive_sla_monitor start```.
